\subsubsection*{Answer}

Since there are two \emph{required} conditions, an OR gate won't help us. 
AND gates check if both inputs are equal to 1, but an AND gate will only be useful if it can check if B is 0. 
Another way to express the puzzle is ``A AND NOT B''. 
Because a NOT gate will convert B from ``off'' to ``on'', then the AND gate will work as we want it to.

The solution is the same for the reverse (check for $B=1$ and $A=0$), provided the NOT gate converts the A input instead of the B input.
