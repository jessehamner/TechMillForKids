\subsection*{A Half Adder}

A \emph{half adder} demonstrates the way in which computer logic gates can correctly add (binary) numbers, though here it can add only two \emph{binary digits} (``bits''). Thus, each half adder can only count to \emph{two}, but that is enough!  Long cascades of half adders and \emph{full adders} enable computers to count large numbers. Below, see two examples of half adders. The second example replaces the XOR gate with a series of simpler gates, but the results are the same. Each half adder takes two bits and adds them, passing on the bits for further work or as an answer itself.

Figure \ref{fig:threehalfadders} shows each of the three possible outcomes of a half adder. Make sure you understand how each result happens.

\subsection*{Full Adder}

This type of adder is a little more difficult to implement than a half-adder. The main difference between a half-adder and a full-adder is that the full-adder has \emph{three} inputs and two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B, just like with every half-adder, and the third input is an input carry, designated as $C_{in}$. Enabling the circuit to handle a carry \emph{in} from another adder makes it possible to add many binary orders of magnitude, since many carry-outs and carry-ins will be needed to add numbers larger than 1. Once we implement a full adder, we can string eight of them together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to the next.

\begin{figure}[!hb]
\begin{center}
\input{./include/fulladder1.tex}
\caption{A full-adder circuit, made up of two half-adder circuits. A full-adder enables carry-in as well as carry-out. This means that the full adder can add \emph{three} inputs together, and keep track of all of them. If the sum is two or three, the carry-out signal goes high. These units can be linked together to make binary addition work even for very large numbers.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Since full adders can accept three inputs, the truth table is pretty big.

\subsection*{Equality}

Comparing two one-bit numbers to see if they are identical is done with XNOR gates. These gates are the same as an XOR gate passing output into a NOT gate.

The symbol for an XNOR gate is:

\caption{A discrete-transistor XNOR gate made up of one XOR and one NOT gate. Tying the output of the XOR gate to the input of the NOT gate makes the result of the NOT gate an XNOR of the original two XOR gate inputs---answering the question ``are the two inputs equal?"}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To compare large numbers, the circuit requires an XNOR gate for each binary digit (bit) in the numbers being compared. If any XNOR gate returns zero, the numbers are not equivalent. To build all of the XNOR gates into a single yes or no answer, each XNOR output could go into a series of AND gates -- that is, since AND returns a ``yes'' only if both inputs are one, a single ``no'' prevents the AND gate from returning ``yes''.

\caption{A circuit to provide a yes/no answer to the question, ``are  two four-bit numbers, A and B, equal?" Each XNOR gate compares the bits in each position of each number, and passes the answer to an AND gate input. The AND results ripple forward to a final answer.}

\caption{Testing for equality with four XNOR gates. Here, XNOR gates are created with XOR gates that pass the output (green wires) to a NOT gate. An XOR gate only goes logic high if the inputs are different. Thus, NOT XOR means both inputs are the same! Each XNOR output (blue wires) passes to a NAND gate. Recall that NAND gates only return zero if both inputs are 1. The output of each NAND gate (purple wires) passes to one input of a NOR gate. So if both inputs to a given NAND gate are ``1'', the NAND gate will show ``0" as its result. NOR gates only return 1 if both inputs are zero. The result: the NOR gate lights up an LED if all inputs are equal. It is no different than the AND-gate cascade shown above in its result, it just uses negative logic to get there. Here, both inputs are equal to 1, so the LED is lit.}
